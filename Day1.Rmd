# WHAT IS R MARKDOWN / R NOTEBOOK?

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.\
When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. It's an experience of coding environment and descriptive note taking TWO-in-ONE.

## To Run a Chunk of R Codes

Try executing the following chunk by\
clicking the **Run** button within the chunk\

or place your cursor inside a chunk of codes and press\
**Cmd+Shift+Enter** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** (Windows).

```{r print range of numbers}
r = 10:19
print(r)
```

```{r plot car datasets}
plot(cars)
```

## To Add a New Chunk of Codes

Click the **Insert Chunk** button on the toolbar\
or\
Press **Cmd+Option+I** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Alt+I** (Windows)

```{r simple r variables declaration}
name <- "Sunny" # assigning "Sunny" to variable 'name'
address = "Hong Kong" # assigning "Hong Kong" to variable address
print(name) # use print() function to show a variable
address # or just directly type the variable name to show it's value
```

## On Saving a Notebook

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it. Click the **Preview** button or Press **Cmd+Shift+K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+K** (Windows) to preview the HTML.

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike **Knit**, **Preview** does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

# MARKDOWN SYNTAX

R Markdown is an easy-to-write plain text format for creating dynamic documents and reports.

## italic text:

*italic text*

## bold text:

**bold text**

## line break:

line 1 (followed by an empty line)

line 2 (add a back slash)\

## headings:

\# Heading 1

\## Heading 2

\### Header 3

## lists:

-   item 1\
-   item 2\
-   item 3

## link:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PRACTICING MARKDOWN 
**5 minutes on this.**
Use the following markdown playground to practice markdown syntax

```{r markdown playground}
browseURL("https://dillinger.io/")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## R Markdown Formats & Options

Press the **gear** icon next to **Preview** button.\
You will see the document in the format of rendered markdown.\
Let's give it a try.\

## R MARKDOWN OUTPUT

Press **Preview** button to see preview of default output.\
Press the **Down** arrow next to **Preview** button to choose a file format to knit.

## Use Notebook or Markdown?

They are pretty much equivalent or at least converatble.\
Only different by automatic added mark-down options at begining of document.

If you are primarily doing analysis in the Notebook environment, choose **Notebook**.

If you are primarily aiming to create a PDF or Word document, choose **R Markdown** file.

# INSTALL & LOAD PACKAGES

Using a 3rd-party library in R will involve TWO steps.\ 
1. Install the required package using **install.packages()** function. (This is only required once for each computer.) \
2. Load the library(libraries) when you need to activate the feature(s) for your R projects/codes using.  Use **library()** function to activate package. (This is required in every time you need the package(s)).

## Install and Load Tidyverse

The codes for this intermediate level workshop heavily depends on **tidyverse** packages.\
**tidyverse** is a collections of packages that are widely used by R data scientist.\
It includes popular data science libraries such as **tidyr**, **tibble**, **readr**, **ggplot2**, **stringr**.

## To install tidyverse, run the statement below

```{r install tidyverse}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

## To load/activate tidyverse, run the statement below

```{r load tidyverse}
library("tidyverse")

```

More about tidyverse, open the following page

```{r browse tidyverse}
browseURL("https://www.tidyverse.org/")
```

## Package Manager: pacman

pacman is 3rd-party Package Manager makes your packages management a lot easier.

Run the following statements to install **pacman** and use **pacman::p_load()** to download and activate required 3rd-party packages. 

With pacman, packages **downloading** and **activating** become two-in-one.

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # check if pacman already installed. If not, install it.
pacman::p_load(datasets, pacman, rio, tidyverse) # Load required packages.  If they are NOT already downloaded, download them automatically.
```

## Show your Library Path
```{r}
.libPaths()
```


## Handy Functions of pacman 
```{r}
?p_data
p_data(datasets) # many data sets included
p_data(rio) # it will show no data sets found
p_data(tidyverse) # it will show no data sets found
p_data(ggplot2)
p_data(tidyr)
p_data(stringr)
p_data(forcats)
p_data(dplyr)
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------


# PIPING: %\>%

## Why Piping?

nested function is difficult to read and therefore usually makes the codes difficult to maintain.

The following nested function call is difficult to read

```{r}
text = "1234.56789"
round(sqrt(as.double(text)),2) # nested function calling starts with the inner most function. as.double() is called first. sqrt() is called second. round is called last.
```

Using piping `%\>%` makes the codes a lot easier to understand Each previous expression will be used as *the first parameter* for the next function call

```{r}
text %>% 
  as.double() %>% 
  sqrt() %>% 
  round(2)
```

## More Examples on Piping

```{r regular function call}
subset(iris,
       Sepal.Length > 5,
       select = c(Species, Sepal.Length)
       )
```

```{r piping the functions call}
iris %>% 
  filter(Sepal.Length>5.0) %>% 
  select(Species, Sepal.Length) 
```

# DATA SCIENCE WORKFLOW

## What is Workflow
Workflow is the preferred step by step order to complete a complex task.

![R Data Science Workflow](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)

Some common steps in data science include: exploring data; wrangling data, visualizing data and modeling. 
These steps are necessarily linear.  They are usually iterative.  Company/team might have very different steps for the sake of intended productivity and efficiency.


## A Glance of Data
Take a galance of your raw data and what to improve

```{r}
allowance = read_csv("./data/allowance.csv")
typeof(allowance) # it says list
class(allowance) # it says multiple class types: "spec_tbl_df", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame"
print(allowance) # prints 10 rows and limited number of columns.
view(allowance) # view the data in separate tab. it shows all rows and columns
summary(allowance) # give you quick overview about the data
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------


# DATA WRANGLING

## What is Data Wrangling?
Data Wrangling is an **iterative process** to prepare, fix and convert your data to fit your data analysis needs.

It has many other names such as data tidying or data cleansing.

## Why Data Tidying?
Garbage In = Garbage Out.

Common problems in raw data:
- missed values
- titles
- image or figures
- merged cell
- summary values
- comments and notes

Tidyverse offers many great features, functions or even potential workflow to help you do data wrangling effortlessly.
In this intermediate workshop, we will massively use features and functions from Tidyverse.

One often used function for data wrangling in R is **mutate()**
**mutate()** is used to create new column or to replace a column.

## Converting Data Type: mutate()
**mutate()** function can add, remove and change columns to fit your needs.

```{r}
print(allowance) # Check 'Personal_Disability_Allowance', it says <chr> characters
summary(allowance) # number column offers basic statistic information.  'Personal_Disability_Allowance' doesn't.

allowance.new = allowance %>% 
  mutate(
    Personal_Disability_Allowance_New = as.numeric(Personal_Disability_Allowance)
  )
print(allowance.new) # a new column named 'Personal_Disability_Allowance_New' as double type is added
summary(allowance.new) # it offers basic statistic information

# we don't have to create new data. we can simply replace the original column and original dataset
allowance = allowance %>% 
  mutate(
    Personal_Disability_Allowance = as.numeric(Personal_Disability_Allowance)
  )
summary(allowance)
```

## Rename a Column
Quite often the column title from Excel or CSV is good for readers to understand, but NOT good for data scientist to do programming.
e.g: 
Annual Salary (Before Tax) '0000

```{r}
allowance  %>% 
  rename(AssessmentYear = Assessment_Year,
         MarriedPerson = Married_Person) 
```


## Assignment Pipes: %<>%
The precess you do wrangling, you usually want to replace the old data set. 
Assignment piping makes this easier.

Note that the previous statement DOESN'T do any changes to the original allowance dataset.

**magrittr** library is required for Assignment Piping

```{r}
library(magrittr)
allowance %<>% # assignment pipe %<>% is used to update the data set
  rename(AssessmentYear = Assessment_Year) %>% 
  rename(MarriedPerson = Married_Person)

# `allowance %<>%` is equivalen to `allowance <- allowance %>%` 
```


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# USING TIBBLE

## What is Tibble?

Instead of using the built-in data-frame, we will use tibble.\
Tibble is a new data structure from tidyverse to replace built-in data-frame.\
Consider tibble an enhanced version of data-frame. In tibble, character vectors are converted to factors for easier data analysis.\

Tibbles are one of the unifying features of the tidyverse. (Most other R packages use regular data frames)
You can convert a data frame to a tibble by using **as_tibble()**

## Tibble offers extras data about data
```{r}
print(allowance) # it shows the column names and their types
```


## Reading CSV as tibble

Use read_csv()

```{r}
graduates = read_csv("data/graduates.csv")
typeof(graduates) # it says "list"
class(graduates) # it says multiple class types: "spec_tbl_df", "tbl_df", "tbl", "data.frame" 
print(graduates)
summary(graduates)
```
## table() function for column insight
Before you start data wrangling, you can use table() function to gain some brief insight on character column.

It shows how many rows for each associated value

```{r}
graduates %>% 
  select(LevelOfStudy) %>% 
  table()
```


## Some Data Wrangling Works
```{r}
graduates = graduates %>% 
  mutate(
    Sex.Converted = as.factor(Sex)
  ) # converting the sex column to factor
summary(graduates) # now you have more meta-data (data about data)
str(graduates) # it shows factor level info
```


## === Exercise ===
Use mutate() function to convert "LevelOfStudy", "ProgrammeCategory" to factor as well.
Make sure you replace the allowance dataset (Don't create new variable)
```{r}
print(graduates)
summary(graduates)
```



## Reading Excel File
```{r}
s = import("./data/Students.xlsx") %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  print()
```

## Loading Live Open Data
data.gov.hk is a central place for access open data from Hong Kong government and public organization.
https://data.gov.hk

Let's Expore Some Dataset by University Grant Commitee
https://data.gov.hk/en-datasets/provider/hk-ugc?order=name&file-content=no

CSV and JSON formats are preferred to data analysis

```{r Student Number by University Live Data}
student.number.by.uni.url = "http://www.ugcs.gov.hk/datagovhk/Approved_Student_Number_Targets(Eng).csv"
student.number.by.uni = read_csv(student.number.by.uni.url)

summary(student.number.by.uni)
```

```{r Student Salary}
student.salaries.url = "http://www.ugcs.gov.hk/datagovhk/Average_Annual_Salaries_FT_Employment(Eng).csv"
student.salaries = read_csv(student.salaries.url)
print(student.salaries)
summary(student.salaries)

# A little bit of data wrangling
student.salaries = student.salaries %>% 
  rename(AnnualSalary = "Average Annual Salary (HK$'000)") %>% # rename the column
  mutate(AnnualSalary = AnnualSalary*1000) %>% # fixing the annual salary value
  mutate(MonthlySalary = AnnualSalary/12) # create a new column: monthly salary
print(student.salaries)
```

```{r Student Unit Cost Live Data}
student.unit.cost.url = "http://www.ugcs.gov.hk/datagovhk/Average_Student_Unit_Cost(Eng).csv"
student.unit.cost = read_csv(student.unit.cost.url)
print(student.unit.cost)
summary(student.unit.cost)
```
## === Exercise ===
Data cleansing on previous student.unit.cost
Suggestions: change the column name and fixed the number by times 1000
Put your answer below
```{r}

```


```{r Incoming Exchange Student Live Data}
exchange.student.url = "http://www.ugcs.gov.hk/datagovhk/Incoming_Exchange(Eng).csv"

summary(graduates.by.uni)
```

```{r Graudates By Programme Category}
# This is the exact data source that provided in the **data** folder
graduates.live.data.url = "http://www.ugcs.gov.hk/datagovhk/Graduates2(Eng).csv"
graduates.live.data = read_csv(graduates.live.data.url)
print(graduates.live.data)
summary(graduates.live.data)
```


## Displaying Tibble In Place

Use print() function to display data in place (right underneath the statement)

```{r}
print(graduates)
```

## Viewing Tibble in Separate Tab

Use view() function to open a separate tab to preview the data. Data will be shown as a separate tab.

```{r}
graduates %>% 
  view()
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

graduates %>% 
  filter(LevelOfStudy=="Taught Postgraduate", 
  ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management") # filtering based on two conditions

```



## Getting Distinct Values: unique()

Use unique() function to display a list of distinct values of a column.

```{r}
AcademicYear = graduates$AcademicYear %>% 
  unique()
print(AcademicYear)

LevelOfStudy = graduates$LevelOfStudy %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  print()

ByLevelOfStudy %>%  tally() # counting number of row in each group
```

## group_by() with multiple variable
```{r}
ByLevelAndProgramme = graduates %>% group_by(LevelOfStudy, ProgrammeCategory)
ByLevelAndProgramme %>%  tally() # counting number of row in each group

```

## Retrieving Group Keys
```{r}
ByLevelAndProgramme %>% group_keys() %>% 
ByLevelAndProgramme %>% group_keys() %>% .[1,] # getting the first row
ByLevelAndProgramme %>% group_keys() %>% .[1:5,] # getting row #1 .. #5
ByLevelAndProgramme %>% group_keys() %>% .[,1] # getting first column
```

## Which Rows Each Group Contains
```{r}
ByLevelAndProgramme %>% group_rows() %>% head()
```



## summarise()
Compute summary for each group
```{r}
