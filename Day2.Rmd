# R DATA VISUALIZATION

## Why Data Visualization?

A whole bunch of raw data points don't provide much insight.

Data Visualization is brilliant in

-   exploring the pattern of data briefly at the early stage
-   in the conclusion, enhance the story telling of data analysis

## Reminder on Workflow

![R Data Science Workflow](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/571b056757d68e6df81a3e3853f54d3c76ad6efc/32d37/diagrams/data-science.png)

Like the picture above shows, in the stage of **Understand** (exploring the data sets), *Transform*, *Visualize* and *Model* are used in an iterative manner so as to get the best early understanding about the data sets.

## Built-in Plot Functions

The advantage of using built-in plotting utilities is they are easy.

It lets you quickly visualize the data pattern while you are trying to gain a brief insight at the early stage of your workflow.

```{r}
plot(iris)
```

## Refresh on Built-in Plot Tools

For built-in R data visualization, go to the **R Intro** project on Github to refresh your memory

(R Intro Source Codes)[<https://github.com/ngsanluk/R-Intro>]

## Grammar of Graphics: ggplot2

If the built-in plotting tools are not enough for you, go for **ggplot2**. It is the most popular data visualization for R.

ggplot2 is an open-source data visualization package for R. ggplot2 breaks up graphs into semantic components such as **scales** and **layers**. Since 2005, ggplot2 has grown in use to become one of the most popular R packages.

## ggplot2 Cheat Sheet

[ggplot 2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# INSTALL / LOAD PACKAGES

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # check if pacman already installed. If not, install it.
pacman::p_load(
  pacman, # package manager
  datasets, # built-in data sets
  rio, # r input / output
  magrittr, # for piping commands
  tidyverse, 
  modelr # mathematics model
) # Load required packages.  If they are NOT already downloaded, download them automatically.
```

# BASIC GRAMMAR

ggplot2 is based on the grammar of graphics, the idea that you can build every graph from the same components below:

**a data set** + **a coordinate system** + **and geom---visual that represent data points**

![Grammar of Graphics](https://jules32.github.io/r-for-excel-users/img/rstudio-cheatsheet-ggplot.png)

## Use Built-in Data Sets

Let's use the built-in cars data set for a simple ggplot

```{r}
print(cars)
```

```{r Generating Empty Plot}
cars %>% ggplot() 
# This only specifies a data set and a coordinate system 
# and therefore it's an empty plot
```

## `geom_point()` function

It's easy to add geometry layer to the base co-ordinate Let's ADD a layer of data points using `geom_point()` function.

And Yes, you can ADD a layer by using the + operator We use `geom_point()` function that requires x and y value for each geom point. In 2D co-ordinate, a point is described by its x and y value.

We need to provide a mapping that specifies the data columns' name to map to a point's x and y value

That mapping is defined by an aesthetics function: `aes()`

We usually name the plot by the type of geom that we use to represent data. In this case, it's widely called Scatter Plot. It is useful to explore the relation of two variables.

```{r}
cars %>% ggplot() + # NOTE: '+' operator must be placed at the end of a line
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist))
```

## Use `geom_line()` to replace geom_point()

`geom_point()` and `geom_line()` require very similar parameters. `geom_line()` is simply an enhanced visualization that automatically connect all the points. Line chart are used to explore/emphasize trending.

```{r}
# just change geom_point to geom_line without change anything else
cars %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist)) 
```

## Use `geom_smoth()` to project a smooth line

`geom_smooth()` and `geom_point()` require very similar parameters. `geom_smooth()` smooths out the line progression

```{r}
# just change geom_point to geom_line without change anything else
cars %>% ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist)) 
```

## Geometric Objects Comparison

a geom is the geometrical object that a plot use to represent data. We used points, lines and smooth above on the same data set and they provide very different message.

We usually name the plot by the name of geom that we use to represent data.

## Adding Multiple Layers

```{r}
# just change geom_point to geom_line without change anything else
cars %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist)) 
```

## Adding Aesthetics to your Plots

Un-comment the extra parameters to add more aesthetics to your plot

```{r}
cars %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=speed, y=dist),
             color = "orange", # the color of data points
             # size = 3, # the size of data point
             # alpha = 0.5, # the transparency of data points, min=0, max=1
             # shape = 0, # the shape of data point
             )
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PLOT WITH OUR OWN DATA

## Loading Data: allowance

```{r reading data files}
allowance = read_csv("./data/allowance.csv")
print(allowance)
```

## Allowance Data Set in Simple Scatterplot

```{r Allowance Scatterplot}
allowance %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping=aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic),
    color = "orange",
    size = 3
    ) 
```

## Continuous Values vs. Discrete Values

Continuous values refer to numbers value that has wide range. E.g. salary, height.

Discrete values refer to a limited number of valid values. It can be string. It can be a few distinct numbers.

When you produce plots, pay attention to what type of value are required by the geom object.

In many cases, you will need to convert the data first. `mutate()` function are quite often used for that.

example:

```{r}
allowance = allowance %>% 
  mutate(Assessment_Year = as.numeric(substr(Assessment_Year, 1 ,4))) 
```

## Simple Line Plot

```{r Allowance Line Graph}
# The following statement WON'T generate a plot
allowance %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic))

# For line graphs, the data points must be grouped so that it knows which points to connect. 
# In this case, all points should be connected, so group=1. 
# When more variables are used and multiple lines are drawn, the grouping for lines is usually done by variable.
allowance %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic, group=1, color="Orange"))
```

## Adding Multiple Layers of Geometry

```{r}
allowance %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic, group=1), color="blue") +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic, group=1), color="blue")

# As both geom use the same data mapping, the above statements can be simplified as
allowance %>% ggplot(aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic, group=1)) +
  geom_line(color="blue") +
  geom_point(color="orange", size=5)
```

## Use `geom_smooth()` to smooth out the line

```{r}
allowance %>% ggplot(aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic, group=1, color="Orange")) +
  geom_smooth() +
  geom_point(size=5)
```

## Save a Plot: `ggsave()`

```{r}
my.first.plot = allowance %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_point(
    mapping=aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic),
    color = "orange",
    size = 3,
    ) 

print(my.first.plot)

ggsave("./output/my_first_plot.png") # default image size
ggsave("./output/my_first_plot_large.png", width=4000, height=2000, unit="px")

```

## Bar Chart with `geom_col()`

```{r}
allowance %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Basic),
           fill="tomato") 
```

## `geom_bar()`

geom_bar() is used for counting the frequency of each occurrence of observed value. It's usually for counting a limit set of values

```{r}
allowance %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=Basic))  
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHALLENGE

## Multiple Layers of Lines

add line plot for column of 'Child' in the same plot, add another line plot for 'Dependent_Parent_60'

```{r}
allowance %>% ggplot() +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Child, group=1), color="Orange") + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x=Assessment_Year, y=Dependent_Parent_60, group=1), color="Blue") 
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# WORK WITH MORE COMPLEX DATA

## Loading Data: graduates.csv

```{r reading complex data}
graduates = read_csv("./data/graduates.csv")
print(graduates)
```

## Simple Scatter-plot

Let's explore the data with some simple ggplot plot. Just some quick exploration. They might not be very useful.

```{r}
ggplot(data=graduates) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount))

ggplot(data=graduates) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, shape=Sex) # use shape to differentiate groups
             )

ggplot(data=graduates) +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, color=Sex) # use color to differentiate groups
             )
```

## Use `filter()` to Extract Required Rows

```{r use filter()}
graduates %>% 
filter(LevelOfStudy=="Undergraduate", ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management") %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, color=Sex)
)
```

## Use Line Plot To Explore the Trending

Use line plot to explore the trending of "Business and Management" student headcount trending

```{r}
library(magrittr)
graduates %<>%
  mutate(AcademicYear=as.factor(AcademicYear),
         Sex=as.factor(Sex)
         ) # convert the 'AcademicYear' and Sex to factor type

graduates %>% 
filter(LevelOfStudy=="Undergraduate", ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management") %>%
ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, 
                         y=Headcount,
                         group=Sex, 
                         color=Sex
                         )
             )

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHALLENGE

## Comparison with Line Plots

Use line plots to compare female undergraduate students headcount trending in "ProgrammeCategory" of "Business and Management" and "Engineering and Technology"

Use `filter()` to extract required records

You can use multiple `filter()` call OrUse &, \| or multiple conditions

```{r Previewing ProgramCategory}
graduates %>% 
  .$ProgrammeCategory %>% # . means the parameter from previous command
  unique() # display the unique names of ProgrammeCategory

graduates %>% 
  filter(LevelOfStudy=="Undergraduate", Sex=="F") %>%
  filter(ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management" | ProgrammeCategory=="Engineering and Technology") %>% 
  print() # Test extracting and printing the required records.
```

```{r Business and Management vs. Engineering and Technology}
graduates %>% 
  filter(LevelOfStudy=="Undergraduate", Sex=="F") %>%
  filter(ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management" | ProgrammeCategory=="Engineering and Technology") %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=AcademicYear, 
             y=Headcount,
             group=ProgrammeCategory, 
             color=ProgrammeCategory
             )
    ) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() 
  
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# CHALLENGE: line plot for hibor_fixing_1m

```{r}
library(jsonlite) # load package

hkma.interbank.url = "https://api.hkma.gov.hk/public/market-data-and-statistics/daily-monetary-statistics/daily-figures-interbank-liquidity"
interbank.liquidity = fromJSON(hkma.interbank.url)
# the above retrieval will take a while.  The server response is slow.

summary(interbank.liquidity)
str(interbank.liquidity)
interbank.liquidity$result
str(interbank.liquidity$result)
interbank.records = interbank.liquidity$result$records %>% as_tibble()
interbank.records

interbank.records %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_line(
    mapping=aes(x=end_of_date, y=hibor_fixing_1m, group=1),
    color="orange"
             )

```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# GROUPING AND AGGREGATION

## Using `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r}
graduates %>% group_by(AcademicYear, LevelOfStudy) %>% 
  summarise(TotalHeadcount = sum(Headcount)) 

graduates %>% group_by(AcademicYear, LevelOfStudy) %>% 
  summarise(TotalHeadcount = sum(Headcount)) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x=AcademicYear, 
             y=TotalHeadcount,
             group=LevelOfStudy, 
             color=LevelOfStudy
             )
    ) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() 
  
```

## Use of filter()

Use `filter()` to keep only "Taught Postgraduate" Records

This plot is not very useful without previously applying `filter()` and `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r}
graduates %>% 
  filter(LevelOfStudy=="Taught Postgraduate") %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear,y=Headcount, group=ProgrammeCategory, color=ProgrammeCategory))
```

## `filter()` + `group_by()` + `summarise()`

Use `filter()` to extract required rows Use `group_by()` and `summarise()` to group and aggregate total headcount for both male and female

```{r ggplot line}

graduates %>% 
  filter(LevelOfStudy=="Taught Postgraduate") %>% 
  group_by(AcademicYear, ProgrammeCategory) %>% 
  summarise(TotalHeadcount = sum(Headcount)) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear,y=TotalHeadcount, group=ProgrammeCategory, color=ProgrammeCategory))

# Following is the same chart for "undergraduate" 
# graduates %>%
#   filter(LevelOfStudy=="Undergraduate") %>%
#   group_by(AcademicYear, ProgrammeCategory) %>%
#   summarise(TotalHeadcount = sum(Headcount)) %>%
#   ggplot() +
#     geom_line(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear,y=TotalHeadcount, group=ProgrammeCategory, color=ProgrammeCategory))
    
```

## `geom_col()` function

```{r}
LevelOfStudy = graduates %>% .$LevelOfStudy %>% unique()
ProgrammeCategory = graduates %>% .$ProgrammeCategory %>% unique() 
print(LevelOfStudy)
print(ProgrammeCategory)
  
graduates %>% 
filter(ProgrammeCategory=="Business and Management") %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, fill=LevelOfStudy))

graduates %>% 
filter(ProgrammeCategory=="Engineering and Technology") %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, fill=LevelOfStudy))

```

## More Aggregation Functions

Center: `mean()`, `median()` Spread: `sd()`, `IQR()`, `mad()` Range: `min()`, `max()`, `quantile()` Position: `first()`, `last()`, `nth()`, Count: `n()`, `n_distinct()` Logical: `any()`, `all()`

More information at [summarise() function](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html)

## geom_bar() function

bar chart give the counting frequency (number of record in the data set)

```{r}
graduates %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear)) # you only need to provide the x axis
```

## box plot

The boxplot compactly displays the distribution of a continuous variable.

It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.

```{r}
graduates %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping=aes(x=Sex, y=Headcount))

graduates %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x=LevelOfStudy, y=Headcount))
```

## `facet_wrap()`

facets are useful categorical variables. It split your plot into subplot (a.k.a facets) that each display one subset of the data.

`facet_wrap()` lets you work with ONE extra variable (besides x and y).\
Each categorical value will used to produce to a sub plot. We use 'LevelOfStudy' here. Since there are FOUR distinct values, you will see FOUR sub-plots

```{r}
graduates %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount)) +
  facet_wrap(~ LevelOfStudy) # You will see FOUR sub plots as there are FOUR distinct values for this variable.
```

## `facet_grid()`

`facet_grid()` lets you work with TWO extra variables (besides x and y).\
Each combination of these two variables' value are used to produce to a sub plot.

You should SEE 28 sub plots as there are FOUR distinct values for 'LevelOfStudy' and 7 distinct values for 'ProgrammeCategory'.

```{r}
graduates %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount)) +
  facet_grid(LevelOfStudy ~ ProgrammeCategory)
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# MAKE IT PRETTY

Use of title, label, background color and themes

```{r}
# in this example we save the plot to a variable name 'level.bar.plot' so that we can use it again and again.
level.bar.plot = graduates %>% 
filter(ProgrammeCategory=="Engineering and Technology") %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_col(mapping=aes(x=AcademicYear, y=Headcount, fill=LevelOfStudy))

# To show the plot, just use print() function with the previous saved plot variable as parameter.
print(level.bar.plot)
```

## Plot Background

`element_rect()` is a function to generated rectangle geometry element. You have to specify the **fill** parameter by color name or hex code code by string

Plot Background refers to the big area of everything relevant to the plot.

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill="orange")) # styling the plot background
```

## Panel Background

Panel background refers to the inner area of plot. Area for showing header, axis label and legend are NOT included.

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill="orange")) # styling the panel background
```

## Remove Plot and Panel Background

In visual design, color is a very powerful tool to guide users' attention. But you have to use them carefully.

Too many colors will usually do the opposite - confuse the audience. Minimal design is the recent trend. Especially true when many are using small device like mobile phone or tablet for day-to-day communication.

In this example, we are removing both plot and panel background to achieve a clean design. After all, background is NOT the main dish. Very often background color causes distraction to graph.

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) # styling the grid line for y-axis
```

## Change Label for x/y Axis

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") # Label for X axis
```

## Rotate the Label Text

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))
```

## Change Fill Colors

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple", "orange", "blue", "tomato")) # use c() function to specify color list
```

## Styling The Legends

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple", "orange", "blue", "tomato"),
                    guide = guide_legend(title="Level of Study", 
                                         label.position = "bottom")
                    ) # move legend position to top and label position to bottom 
  
```

## Add Title and Subtitle

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple", "orange", "blue", "tomato"),
                    guide = guide_legend(title="Level of Study", 
                                         label.position = "bottom")
                    ) + # move legend position to top and label position to bottom 
  ggtitle("Hong Kong Higher Education Student Headcount", subtitle="2009 - 2019")
```

## Add Annotations Texts

Add extra texts/shape to enhance your visualization

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple", "orange", "blue", "tomato"),
                    guide = guide_legend(title="Level of Study", 
                                         label.position = "bottom")
                    ) + # move legend position to top and label position to bottom 
  ggtitle("Hong Kong Higher Education Student Headcount", subtitle="2009 - 2020") + 
  annotate("text", label="Record\nHigh", x="2017/18", y=5300) # you can change text position value of x and y to set the text position
```

## Adding Reference Lines

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme(panel.background = element_blank()) + # styling the panel background to none
  theme(plot.background = element_blank()) + # styling the plot background to none
  theme(panel.grid.major.y = element_line(color="grey")) + # styling the grid line for y-axis
  ylab("Number of Student") + # Label for Y axis
  xlab("Year") + # Label for X axis
  theme(legend.position="top") +
  scale_fill_manual(values=c("purple", "orange", "blue", "tomato"),
                    guide = guide_legend(title="Level of Study", 
                                         label.position = "bottom")
                    ) + # move legend position to top and label position to bottom 
  ggtitle("Hong Kong Higher Education Student Headcount", subtitle="2009 - 2019") + 
  annotate("text", label="Record\nHigh", x="2017/18", y=5300) + # you can change text position value of x and y to set the text position
  geom_hline(yintercept=3200) + # adds horizontal line
  geom_vline(xintercept = "2017/18", color="white") # adds vertical line
  
```

## Using Themes

```{r}
level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme_bw() # black and white theme

level.bar.plot +
  theme_minimal() # black and white theme

level.bar.plot +
  theme_dark() # black and white theme
```

## More 3rd-party Themes

Install **ggthemes** package to unlock wider selections of themes.

```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # check if pacman already installed. If not, install it.
pacman::p_load(ggthemes)

level.bar.plot # default style

level.bar.plot +
  theme_excel() + # Excel Theme
  ggtitle("Excel Theme")
  

level.bar.plot +
  theme_wsj() + # Wall Street Journal Theme
  ggtitle("Wall Street Journal Theme")

level.bar.plot +
  theme_economist() + # Economist Theme
  ggtitle("Economist Theme")

level.bar.plot +
  theme_fivethirtyeight() + # Five Thirty Eight
  ggtitle("Five Thirty Eight Theme")

![Work Follow of Data Science](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e5bf2a8f4c787a12facbc0b4191fc82bd192f4c5/4e5d2/diagrams/data-science-model.png)

Data Science is combination of efforts and results of programming, mathematics and domain expertise. Among all, mathematics is the foundation of models. With models, data scientists make predictions; discover hidden patterns; and conclude insights.

Modeling is usually an iterative process among data transformation, data visualization, exploring with models and fitting.

## What exactly is a Model?

Human are good in drawing conclusions and providing insight while are NOT good in directly facing large number of data attributes and huge volume of raw data.

![Models Example](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e28a66adf6e8b2d127db8d3af9ac992a2abb87ce/47308/model-basics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-45-1.png)

A model is mathematics expression that provides a simple low-dimensional **summary** of a data set so that we can draw conclusion and even provide insights.

Models only provide approximation (NOT the exact truth).

## Basic Concepts of Model

Let's do some simple R coding to uncover the basic concept of model

```{r Loading Required Packages }
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman") # install pacman
pacman::p_load(pacman, tidyverse, modelr, magrittr) # install (or load) required packages
```

Let's use a simple built-in data set **sim1** for exploring. In this simulation data, you can strongly see the pattern with the help of simple scatter-plot.

```{r Using sim1 Data Set}
p_data(modelr) # display all the built-in data sets of modelr
print(heights)
?heights
print(sim1) # contains two continuous variables: x, y

ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Generating a Random Linear Model

Linear line and quadratic curve are widely used to explore the relation of two variables. Let's take linear model as simple example to grab the essence of model.

A linear model is described as `y = a1 + x * a2` x and y are the variable from data set a1 and a2 are parameters that can vary to capture different patterns.

Let's generate a random value of `a1` as **intercept** and `a2` as **slope**. Here, we use `runinf()` to generate random uniform distributed number

**Note**: You might have to repetitively run a few times before you can see the visualized random model represented by a orange straight line.

```{r}
model = tibble(
  a1 = runif(1, -20, 40), # random intercept value between -20 to 40
  a2 = runif(1, -5, 5) # random slop value between -5 to 5
)
# print(model) # un-comment to print the random model

ggplot(sim1, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point() + # this plots all the data
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2), 
              data=model, 
              color="Orange"
              ) # this add the straight line, a.k.a, our random model on top to data layer
```

## Generating 250 Random Models as Candidate Models

The number of potential models are unlimited. Let's try to generate 250 random ones as candidate models.\
Among these 250 models, some are very bad that you can judge even by glancing. Some are not bad but we don't know which one is the best among them.

```{r}
models = tibble(
  a1 = runif(250, -20, 40), # 250 random intercept values between -20 to 40
  a2 = runif(250, -5, 5) # 250 random slop values between -5 to 5
)

# let add these random linear models as overlay on top of data 
ggplot(sim1, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2), data=models, alpha=0.2)
```

## Selecting the Most Fitting Ten Models

```{r}
# this function calculates the modeled y value of each given 'x' value
modeled_y = function(a, data) {
  a[1] + data$x * a[2] # a[1] is the intercept and a[2] is the slope
}
# modeled_y(c(7, 1.5), sim1) # test-run modeled_y function

# this function calculates the distance between an actual y value and the predicted y value (modeled_y)
measure_distance = function(mod, data) {
  diff <- data$y - modeled_y(mod, data) # mod is random intercept and slope of a certain model
  sqrt(mean(diff ^ 2)) # root-mean-squared deviation to compute overall distance
}
# measure_distance(c(7, 1,5), sim1) # test-run measure_distance function

# this function calculates the 'overall' distance for a given model with a1 as intercept and a2 as slope
sim1_dist = function(a1, a2) {
  measure_distance(c(a1, a2), sim1) # a1 is the intercept of a model while a2 is the slope
}

# use map2_dbl (a mapping function) to a new column named 'dist' to each random model
models %<>% 
  mutate(dist = purrr::map2_dbl(a1, a2, sim1_dist))
models # now we have an extra column named 'dist' in our models

# plotting the best 10 models from the ranked distances
ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, colour = "grey30") + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(intercept = a1, slope = a2, color = -dist) , 
    data = filter(models, rank(dist) <= 10) # To show only the best 5, change 10 to five
  )

```

## Using `lm()` function

If the previous R codes on choosing best 10 among 250 random models are too much digest. It's fine. It's just for you to feel the process and essence of models and fitting models.

In fact, R makes linear model fitting extremely easy by just one single line of function calling to the `lm()` function (a built-in linear model fitting function)

`lm()` finds the closest model in a single step, using a sophisticated algorithm that involves geometry, calculus, and linear algebra.

**lm()** has a special way to specify the model family: formulas. Formulas look like **y \~ x**, which `lm()` will translate to a function like y = a1 + a2 \* x

```{r}
# regular function calling manner
sim1_auto_model = lm(y ~ x, data = sim1) # finding the optimized linear model
# Or using piping below
sim1_auto_model = sim1 %>%  lm(y ~ x, .) # since piping always assumes outputs from previous function call will be the first parameter of next function, here we use "." to indicate sim1 will be fed as second parameter

print(sim1_auto_model) # print out the auto generated linear model
print(summary(sim1_auto_model)) # print out the summary of the generated linear model

sim1_coef = coef(sim1_auto_model) # retrieves model's intercept and slope
print(sim1_coef)

# visualize the auto generated linear model on top of the sim1 data
ggplot(sim1, aes(x, y)) + 
  geom_point(size = 2, colour = "grey30") + 
  geom_abline(
    aes(intercept = sim1_coef[1], slope = sim1_coef[2]) 
  )
```

Making Prediction

```{r}
new.data = data.frame(x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10))
predict(sim1_auto_model, new.data)
```

## Using lm() function with categorical data

Using `lm()` function on a categorical variable will use mean value for each category for prediction.

```{r}
p_data(modelr) # shows included data sets with modelr package
sim2 %>% summary()
sim2 
model_cat = sim2 %>%  lm(y~x, .)
print(model_cat)
grid = sim2 %>% 
  data_grid(x) %>% 
  add_predictions(model_cat)
grid

ggplot(sim2, aes(x)) + 
  geom_point(aes(y = y)) +
  geom_point(data = grid, aes(y = pred), colour = "red", size = 4)
```

```{r}
sim3
```

## Multiple Regression

Multiple regression is an extension of linear regression into relationship between more than two variables.

```{r}
?mtcars
print(mtcars)
m.r.model = mtcars %>% lm(mpg~disp+hp+wt, .)
print(m.r.model)

new.data.2 = data.frame(
  disp = c(221),
  hp = c(102),
  wt = c(2.91)
  ) %>% print()

predict(m.r.model, new.data.2)
```

## Logistic Regression

```{r}
print(mtcars)
bi.model = mtcars %>% glm(am~cyl+hp+wt, ., family=binomial)
print(bi.model)

new.data.3 = data.frame(
  cyl = c(4),
  hp = c(102),
  wt = c(3.91)
  ) %>% print()
predict(bi.model, new.data.3)

new.data.3b = data.frame(
  cyl = c(4,6,8),
  hp = c(102,110,98),
  wt = c(2.91, 2.62, 3.44)
  ) %>% print()
summary(bi.model)
predict(bi.model, new.data.3b)
```

# VISUALIZATION VS. MODEL

Visualization is usually thought as a tool for hypothesis generation to explore the hidden patterns among data while modelling is usually thought as at tool for hypothesis confirmation (to confirm what are found by data visualization tools). These two tools are suggested to used in an iterative manner so as to achieve a deeper revealing on data.
